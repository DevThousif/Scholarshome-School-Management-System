This project is a school project made by three friends.
The purpose of this project is to make teachers administrative tasks easier by making it computer oriented. 
How to use it:
A school admin can use this to enter data of teachers into the database. If there is a change in the current routine as in substitute of any other the teacher, the substitute will get an email on when to take the class (which is completely automated). There is a presentation folder which contains a powerpoint ppt on how this helps the school administrative branch. 

***This is just a prototype and is not complete. This project was made when we were in class 10 for our school ICT Fair.
